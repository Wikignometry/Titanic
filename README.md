Analysis of the Kaggle Titanic dataset

Full disclaimer: this is some really old code that was written when I didn't know how proper documentation worked so it may be quite difficult to navigate

* Dataplay and TitanicPlay are both explorations of the dataset
* TitanicClean is where the dataset is cleaned
* TitanicPrediction is where the Logistical Regression model actually gets applied
